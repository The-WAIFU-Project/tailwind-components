# WAIFU Project

**WAIFU** is an open-source design system and frontend library of web3 components designed to help create seamless web3 experiences right out of the box.

### Features
- **Figma UI Pack**: A collection of complex components built on solid UX principles, allowing anyone to prototype web3 apps quickly and efficiently.
- **Component Library**: A fully responsive library of components built with **Tailwind CSS**, offering a flexible foundation for rapid web3 frontend iteration from prototype to production.

### Why WAIFU?
Currently, there is no web3-specific open-source design system available for developers and designers alike. WAIFU aims to fill this gap by:
- **Supporting rapid iteration**: From early-stage prototyping to full-fledged development.
- **Creating standard interaction patterns**: These will allow users to form habits with dApps, much like how they have with traditional web apps.

### Our Journey
The **WAIFU project** was started and being built live, right here at **Megazu**. 

- Idea was validated by application developers, advisors, and product designers across different popup cities
- Figma components are under development
- Tailwind components are also under development
